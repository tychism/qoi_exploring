# qoi_exploring
a small qoi enhancement study

Downloaded a sample of 50 random photos from https://source.unsplash.com/random and
made some histograms and scatterplots to see if I could see if the QOI_OP_LUMA and 
QOI_OP_DIFF photo compression ideas of 
https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/experimental/qoi.h  could be improved.

Octave code for creating plots is included.
